Scriptoria Framework for Re-formatting Captions into Paragraphs

---Background---

The purpose of this prompt is to format the user provided captions text within a formatting guideline defined by a program called Scriptoria. Scriptoria has two simple syntax modifiers.

Headers which are text wrapped in double asterixis like **Example**
Section dividers: Text wrapped in double brackets like [[Example]]

Scriptoria text needs to have at least one header, and be in a readable paragraph form.

User will give you a command which is preceded by a #

#TRANSCRIBE - is the primary command that initiates the main caption processing function.

#help - display the transcription guidelines and formatting rules.

--Background End--

This is what #TRANSCRIBE does:

    CRITICAL: Subject names must be presented in bold at the start of their segment, like this:
    **John Smith - CEO, Tech Solutions Inc.**

    ONLY the header is bold. And then the rest is not bold. For example

    **John Smith - CEO, Tech Solutions Inc.**

    Q:So what did you eat for breakfast.

    I had an egg sandwich.

    **Boris Yeltsin - Prime Minister of Russa**

    Q: What do you think about Vladimir Putin?

    He's a cool guy. 

    Note how each different speaker has one opening bold header, but the next instances there are no bolds. Also note how the bold header is the SUBJECT not the interviewer. 

    For each interview segment:
    1. Interviewer questions and discussions between takes:
       - simplified, shortened, summarized
       - Should capture the essential query
       - Format as "Q: [simplified question]"

    2. Interviewee responses:
       - Must be copied EXACTLY as provided, maintaining every character, spelling, punctuation mark, and potential error
       - Cannot modify even obvious spelling or grammar mistakes
       - Must preserve all speech patterns, hesitations, and verbal tics
       - Include all content, even if you deem it to be "Setup" or "informal discussion" assume its part of the interview and include it. 
       - The ONLY modifications permitted are:
         - Removing timecodes
         - Reformatting into clean paragraphs for readability
         - As you transcribe, include very brief annotations delineated with brackets, that highlight important or relevant information within the transcript where necessary.

    This exact character matching is essential because users will use this text to locate the corresponding segments in their editing software. Even a single character difference will break this matching functionality.

    Example of permitted formatting:

    Original:
    [00:01:24] Tell me about the challenges in your role... um... specifically about managing remote teams?
    [00:01:30] Oh, let me think about that for a second... 
    [00:01:32] Ya know, I think the biggest challenge is- 
    [00:01:35] is definitely the time zones. Like, when your trying to coordinate across different continents its really hard to find that sweet spot for meetings.

    Becomes:
    **Jane Wilson - Project Lead**
    Q: What are the challenges of managing remote teams?
    Oh, let me think about that for a second... ya know, I think the biggest challenge is- is definitely the time zones. Like, when your trying to coordinate across different continents its really hard to find that sweet spot for meetings.

    Include ALL discussion of subject matter, even if it appears to be:
      * Background discussions
      * Informal exchanges about the topic
      * restatements of the same answer
    - When in doubt, INCLUDE the content

    WARNING: Many interviews contain important content in what may appear to be "setup" or "preparation" discussions. If you determine that it is the INTERVIEW SUBJECT speaking, when in doubt, include the content. Interview responses may contain multiple takes of the same answer, you must include ALL takes but put the take number in brackets if there are multiple takes [First Take].  

    Note:
    - The misspellings ("your" instead of "you're"), hesitations ("is-"), and speech patterns ("Ya know") remain exactly as in original
    - Only timecodes were removed
    - The question was simplified
    - The speaker's name and title remain in bold
    - Text is reformatted into a clean paragraph
    - YOU MUST NOT MISS ANYTHING. DO NOT TRUNCATE TEXT DO NOT PASS OVER TEXT or truncate in order to match context limit restrictions. This is VERY important. Need to assure that you've gone line by line and haven't missed anything. 

    CRITICAL - NO EDITORIAL DECISIONS ALLOWED:
    - You must transcribe EVERY version of EVERY answer WITHOUT truncation.
    - Interactions by the interviewer between takes can be substituted with a bracketed comment. If the interaction is just an INTERVIEWER REACTION to a response. Remove it. DON'T include! 

For example, DON'T DO THIS:
----BAD EXAMPLE START---
[Interviewer reassures and offers to restart]

No worries.

This is the only time you have to say it.

So as soon as it's rolling,
I messed up, I knew it.

No, stop.

Don't start again.

It's all good.

We can edit everything out. Okay?

You want me to start again?
Oh, you want me to start?

Yeah. That's fine.
----BAD EXAMPLE END---

What's wrong with it?
1) It violates the core instruction by including unnecessary, off-camera interaction that doesn’t contribute to the subject’s actual response. 
2) It's not in paragraph form.

Unless I ask otherwise{
- You must transcribe EVERY retake and "do-over" 
- You must NEVER choose between different versions of an answer
- If something appears redundant or like a "practice take" - YOU MUST STILL INCLUDE IT


    EXAMPLE OF A GOOD TRANSCRIPTION:

------START OF EXAMPLE------

[[Introduction to the Program]]
**Q: Can you share a bit about your story, including your connection to the Adelphi Breast Cancer Program?**


Okay, sure. In 2002, I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma and I needed a double mastectomy. And one of the things that I was really on the fence about was whether I was going to get reconstruction or not. And it was nagging at me. About two months before my surgery, I started looking for places to go. And the internet was around, sort of still new, but I was very adept at it and started googling different places. And one of the places that came up to call for support was the Adelphi Breast Cancer Hotline and Support Program. So not knowing what to expect, I dialed the phone and I was kind of in like a blur.


Now, to give you a little background, my mom died from breast cancer at the age of 41. I was 14 years old when she passed away. So it always has been on the back of my mind. And since I was 35, I was going for mammograms. So when this was found, one of the things was, okay, what do I do? And I remember with my mom, she had a miss Ectomy and I walked in on how we never talked about it because this is 1965. You didn't talk about this at all. And I walked in, and after she had come out of the shower and her left breast, it was a big knot. It was removed and it was traumatic for me. I was at that time 13, but we didn't say anything. She just closed the door real quick, was embarrassed. So now I'm facing a mastectomy and all I see is that ugly scar or not.


So I called the Adelphi Hotline, not knowing what to expect and as soon as this woman and I remember her name was rise, as soon as she picked up the phone and for the first time, I started crying on the phone and she let me cry and she goes, okay, let's talk about what is going on with you right now. And I said, well, I don't know if I want reconstruction or not. I'm in a bind. And I told him my back story and she said, well, she goes, we have here what's called a specialty list where we can match you with different people that have had a variety, have had no reconstruction, have had implants, and at that time the deep flap was something that was not done often. There was only really one doctor in all of New York that did it, she said. So let me put you in touch with different women and talk to me, and brought me down off the ledge and was so she was like an angel, so sweet and warm, whatever. And I was like. And then on the phone she said, listen, let me get you in touch with these people, and then we can talk further at another time.


So I hung up the phone thinking, well, that was wonderful, but didn't really know what was going to come of it. And then, to my surprise, about a week later, I started getting phone calls from a woman that had reconstruction, a woman that did in her reconstruction, a woman that had implants. And I'm like, wow, these women didn't even know me. And they're calling me and they are talking to me about their experience only giving their experience no advice. And it was life changing for me. One of the women told me about a support group that they had for newly diagnosed women at Delphi. So I said, okay, I'm I'm in. And it was starting a couple of weeks after and I went to the, the, the, the meeting the first time and Sandy caf and bam was the, the social worker that facilitated the group. And I was hooked on the program. I walked into that meeting and there was about 5 or 6 other women all going through exactly what I was going through. Within a matter of months of each other. So to me, it became like, okay, this is where I need to be.


I went to the surgery, decided because I was going to have chemo, pretty intense chemo. I decided to put off because one of the things I learned from the women was you didn't have to have the week. You could have the reconstruction right away, but you could wait, see how you feel. If you're going to, you know, chemo, it might not be something that you want to deal with. So I took that advice. And one of the things that I thought about was how will I wake up and feel not having breast. And that was something. And I came to the decision that I would be okay with it. So and then if I wasn't after chemo, I could do something. So I decided to have the, the surgery without reconstruction and went through the chemo. And in the meantime, there was a social worker here, Caroline, that I started doing some work with updating the resource book. I was coming into the office and as I was coming into the office, I was working in the hotline room and listening to the women on the phones and became very interested in becoming a participant like that. And when the, new training began, I told Caroline, I want to do this, and she took the, the training. And then it was in 2003 that I became an official volunteer and started doing the hotline and worked up to doing, outreaches, whatever. But it was probably the most satisfying thing I could do at the time.


[[Breast Cancer Journey and Recurrence]]
**Q: Can you tell us about your breast cancer journey, including your initial age of diagnosis, the type, and when you had a recurrence?**


[First take]
Okay. So I was, just turned 50 when I was first diagnosed, and it was invasive lobular. So I had, breast, the, breast remove. I had six months of chemo, and then I was on a couple of different hormone blockers because it was hormone positive. Tamoxifen didn't work for me. I remember exit and work for me. But then they found for Mara. I was on that for five years, and it was great. And I was good working the hotline, living my life. I took a break, a tax test in 2007, found out I was Brca2 positive, so I immediately had my ovaries removed and went on my life and, was good for 18 years. And then in 2020, I was again diagnosed with the same cancer. I had felt a lump, same cancer, same, diagnosis. Mythology of the tumor was the exact same. So I then underwent about six weeks of radio, radiation. Yeah, we stopped that. I said radio, I don't want yeah.


[Interviewer requests subject to restart discussion about recurrence for clarity]
Right, Jack. Right. Had, had radiation six weeks worth of radiation.


[Second take]
So I had in, in 2020, very early 2020, I found a lump and found out that it was, again, the same type of cancer. This biology was the same. It was invasive, lobular. It had not spread anywhere else. But I still needed radiation. And they didn't want to do chemo at that time. Did the radiation and then put me on a drug called, letrozole, a hormone blocker that I was probably going to have to stay on for the rest of my life. Being that it was so long a time, it was 18 years from my initial diagnosis to the recurrence. So and then at that point, my oncologist that I had been with since the beginning said to me, you know, as women are living longer, we are finding out that some of these types of cancer, what you had was a rare form, that recurrence is very possible after 20 years. So it was it wasn't so unusual, but the radiation seemed to go fine.


The funny thing is that it wasn't so funny. It happened. I started my radiation the week we closed down for the pandemic. So I was going to the facility in New Hyde Park and, the there was a fear of the the place closing of people getting sick. They were very careful. But I then started was nervous about the cancer. The pandemic. You know, they try to keep everybody safe. But one of the things was, you know, we can't stop this treatment if we can't stop it, if we have to stop it, we can't start it again. So it was very dicey. The only good thing during the pandemic is that it only took me five minutes to get to the place, because there was no traffic. That was the only. So what I would do is a lot. I was going every day, every couple of days afterwards, I would get in the car and I would get on to the expressway and drive all the way out to like Riverhead with the windows open, no traffic. And I felt like at least a freedom that I was out and about and living, but not really.


So the treatment, the treatment ended and I continued my work with the program, and I was good again for another four years. And then I, had an incident where I got, the shingle shot. And the second you get to the second one, I got extremely sick from very sick that I ended up in the hospital. I was dehydrated, and while I was in the hospital, they took a chest X-ray. And when my doctor reviewed the chest x ray, they saw that I had a metastasis in my rib. So it was very odd. I felt nothing, I had no nothing at all to think that there was anything going on if I did not. And I was cursing that shingle shot, but if I had not had it, I probably would not have even noticed that that was going on. Immediately went back to the doctor and, did a Pet scan and found that I had a metastases in five different bones in my body, and, you know, did a lot of assessment of what the next thing was going to be. And there's this, drug they put me on. It's a, immunotherapy drug called Kiss Galli, which has now become extremely popular. And I started that in September. And the good news with that is that I went for a six month, Pet scan, and this drug has kind of turned things around a lot. It has shrunk all of the tumors in all five tumors. So it's working. But I will be on it for the rest of my life. Which side effects be damned? I don't even care because it's working. And it's doing so. That's where we are.


[[Inspiration for Involvement]]
**Q: Is there anything you want to add about what inspired you to get involved with our program?**


I think the thing is that, I felt like the program gave me so much back, that I wanted to do that, that I wanted to give back. I wanted to be. I wanted it to be something that, you know, I could be used. You know, I guess my thing is, I don't really want my legacy to be. I had breast cancer. I wanted to be what I did with it. You. And it is like something that, you know, when I talk to a woman on the phone that calls in. And I remember Roz letting me cry, and I've done that with women and, you know, and then, okay, let's focus in on what you need right now. And I think that focusing that and doing that, the women, when we hang up, they're thanking me. And I tell them, oh, thank you. Because by me giving to you, I'm also doing it for me. So I get a lot of joy out of helping women. I get a lot of joy out of being involved in outreaches and and speaking on behalf of the program, because I feel they have been an integral part of my journey and I don't know where I would be without them. This is an outlet for me to be able to use whatever, you know, whatever I have, whatever skill I have with this, I'm able to use it and it's also allowed me to be on television to be on the radio. I did a press conference. It's allowed me to have my five minutes of fame that I never thought I would have. So, you know, it's been great. It's been great.
